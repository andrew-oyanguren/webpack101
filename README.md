# Webpack Learning Project

This project was created as a hands-on way to learn and explore the features of Webpack, a powerful module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. The goal is to understand Webpack's core concepts, configuration, and how it can improve the development and production workflows.

## Features

- Entry and Output: Define single and multiple entry points and configure output files.
- Loaders: Use loaders to process various file types like CSS, images, and modern JavaScript syntax.
- Plugins: Implement plugins to optimize the build process.
- Development Server: Set up a development server with live reloading.
- Code Splitting: Explore lazy loading and dynamic imports for better performance.
- Environment Modes: Create configurations for development and production environments.
- Tree Shaking: Learn how to remove unused code in production builds.
- Custom Configuration: Experiment with custom Webpack configurations.

## Key Concepts Explored

- Entry Points: Configuring how Webpack starts building dependency graphs.
- Loaders and Plugins: Using Babel, CSS loaders, file loaders, and common plugins like HtmlWebpackPlugin and CleanWebpackPlugin.
- Optimization: Techniques such as minification, tree shaking, and splitting chunks for efficient builds.
- Source Maps: Enabling better debugging in development mode.
- Custom Scripts: Adding npm scripts for different build tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

- Configuring Webpack for small to medium-sized projects.
- Optimizing JavaScript and CSS for production.
- Understanding how Webpack fits into modern front-end workflows.
